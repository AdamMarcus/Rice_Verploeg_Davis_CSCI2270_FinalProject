# Rice_Verploeg_Davis_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Summary: Our final project is a Jeopardy style trivia game using an array of linked lists to represent the game board. The users will have the option to play one of two premade games or to create their own game to play. Each node represents a question, and it will store the answer and point value as well. The program needs to have two arguments in order to run the premade games which are the names of the two text files: "game1.txt" and "game2.txt". While one person can operate the program smoothly, it is designed to be a competitive game between two people.

How to Run: In order to run this properly, the arguments must be the given text files. After building and running the program, the menus will guide users through the game.

Dependencies: No dependencies.
